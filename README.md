# HAKKA!

A reddit-like online community (but less noisy).

Note that the web app isn't finished and not yet localized for English-speaking folks, but that's on my todo list.

The API part will also be open sourced in 2021.

## Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Building

```bash
yarn build
```
